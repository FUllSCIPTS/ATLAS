# ATLAS ride-hailing UML blueprint

Use this blueprint to reproduce or extend ATLAS end to end. It covers four layers:

- **Android app** — ATLAS Go, the Python/Kivy passenger app on the `main` branch ([`android-app/`](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/tree/main/android-app)): solo rides, shared rides, food ordering, activity and privacy, stored on the device.
- **Web front end** — the passenger and driver browser pages served by the gateway in this starter.
- **Back end** — the FastAPI gateway, trip, dispatch and model services, the event worker, Kafka, and ML training and serving.
- **Databases** — the device's `state.json`, the starter's PostgreSQL (or local SQLite) schema, the Kafka event log and the model artifact volume.

The Android app runs offline today. [Connecting the Android app to the back end](#connecting-the-android-app-to-the-back-end) maps each on-device command to the starter API, and labels the food and shared-ride parts the back end does not yet implement.

[Final handover and runbook](FINAL_HANDOVER.md) · [Runnable starter](../README.md) · [Android app source](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/tree/main/android-app) · [Android app architecture](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/blob/7e98e016c8f3b71f82e81b8226f2d8667614f2ac/android-app/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) · [Machine-readable symbol inventory](uml-blueprint.json) · [Build specification](../../dist/build-spec.json) · [Kafka event contract](../packages/ride-event.schema.json)

## Start from the implementation

Clone the branch and run the unmodified starter before changing contracts or behavior.

```bash
git clone --branch architecture-explorer --single-branch https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS.git
cd ATLAS/architecture-explorer/starter
docker compose up -d --build
docker compose exec -T gateway python -m tests.smoke
docker compose exec -T gateway python -m tests.policy
docker compose exec -T -e KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP=kafka:9092 gateway python -m tests.replay
```

The [local SQLite quickstart](../README.md#start-locally-without-docker) runs the same business handlers without a broker. The full Compose run is the acceptance check for the PostgreSQL and Kafka deployment.

## Android app (ATLAS Go)

The Android app lives on the `main` branch at [`android-app/`](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/tree/main/android-app). Every screen, rule, storage operation and test is Python. Links below point to the source at commit [`7e98e01`](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/blob/7e98e016c8f3b71f82e81b8226f2d8667614f2ac/android-app).

### App layers

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    U["AtlasGoApp<br/>screens · navigation · buttons"] --> L["LocalStore<br/>commands · validation · rollback"]
    L --> DM["domain.py<br/>fare · distance · Offer · Cart · MENU"]
    L --> J[("state.json<br/>app-private storage")]
    X["Acceptance<br/>debug builds only"] --> U
```

The UI never edits state directly. It calls a `LocalStore` command; the store applies domain rules, writes the file atomically, and restores the previous in-memory state if the write fails.

Module functions in [`domain.py`](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/blob/7e98e016c8f3b71f82e81b8226f2d8667614f2ac/android-app/atlas_go/domain.py): `distance(pickup, destination)` reads the 4 × 4 kilometre table, `fare(pickup, destination, comfort)` returns `(350 + km × 170)` cents with a 30 % comfort uplift, and `money(cents)` formats euros. All money is integer cents.

### Screen navigation

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> home
    home --> ride : Ride
    home --> share : Share ride
    home --> food : Food
    ride --> active_ride : book_solo
    share --> active_ride : book_shared
    active_ride --> activity : completed or cancelled
    food --> menu : open_menu
    menu --> cart : basket
    cart --> active_order : checkout
    active_order --> activity : delivered
    home --> profile : You
    profile --> privacy
    note right of home
        Bottom bar on every screen:
        Home · Share · Food · Activity · You (profile)
    end note
```

The current screen and form choices are saved in `ui` so the app reopens where the user left it.

### On-device ride and order lifecycles

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    state "Ride" as R {
        [*] --> driver_confirmed : book (stage 0)
        driver_confirmed --> at_pickup : simulate (stage 1)
        at_pickup --> on_your_way : simulate (stage 2)
        on_your_way --> Completed : complete
        driver_confirmed --> Cancelled : cancel
        at_pickup --> Cancelled : cancel
        on_your_way --> Cancelled : cancel
    }
    state "Food order" as F {
        [*] --> kitchen_preparing : checkout (stage 0)
        kitchen_preparing --> courier_on_the_way : simulate (stage 1)
        courier_on_the_way --> arriving : simulate (stage 2)
        arriving --> Delivered : mark delivered
    }
```

Only one active ride and one active order can exist. Cancelling a shared ride releases its seats back to the offer. Completed, cancelled and delivered records move to `history`. Stages advance only when the user presses the simulation button.

### On-device data model (`state.json`)

The app's only database is one JSON document in app-private storage. Each save writes `state.tmp`, calls `fsync`, then atomically replaces `state.json`. Damaged JSON is kept as `state.invalid.json` and a clean demo state is created. Android backup is disabled.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    STATE ||--|| CART : "cart"
    STATE ||--o| RIDE : "ride (active)"
    STATE ||--o| ORDER : "order (active)"
    STATE ||--o{ HISTORY_RECORD : "history"
    STATE ||--o{ SEATS : "seats per offer"
    STATE ||--|| UI : "ui"
    CART ||--o{ CART_ITEM : "items"
    ORDER ||--|{ CART_ITEM : "items"
    STATE {
        object cart
        array history
        object ride
        object order
        object seats
        object ui
    }
    CART_ITEM {
        string dish_id "bowl, wrap, juice, pizza, ..."
        int quantity "1 to 10"
    }
    RIDE {
        string id "R- plus nanosecond timestamp"
        int pickup "0..3 PLACES"
        int destination "0..3, not pickup"
        bool shared
        int party "1 or 2"
        string offer "pool-1..pool-4 or null"
        string driver
        int fare "cents"
        int stage "0..2"
        string status "Completed or Cancelled in history"
    }
    ORDER {
        string id "F- plus nanosecond timestamp"
        int restaurant "0..2"
        int address "0..3 PLACES"
        object items
        int fare "cents incl. 250 delivery"
        int stage "0..2"
        string status "Delivered in history"
    }
    SEATS {
        string offer_id "pool-1..pool-4"
        int seats "0..capacity"
    }
    UI {
        string screen
        int pickup
        int destination
        int party
        bool comfort
        int restaurant
        int address
    }
```

Reference data is compiled into [`domain.py`](https://github.com/FUllSCIPTS/ATLAS/blob/7e98e016c8f3b71f82e81b8226f2d8667614f2ac/android-app/atlas_go/domain.py), not stored: four places (UCC Campus, Cork City Centre, Kent Station, Cork Airport), three restaurants (Green Bowl Kitchen, Marina Pizza, Spice Route), nine dishes, and four shared-ride offers seeded by `LocalStore.reset`. `LocalStore.validate` checks every loaded field (types, ranges, known offer IDs, basket limits) before a screen reads it.

### Booking and ordering on the device

    Passenger->>UI: Simulate next stage
    UI->>Store: advance_ride() or advance_order()
    Store->>File: save() and move finished records to history
```

## Component and deployment boundaries

Only the gateway is published on the host loopback interface in the starter. The trip, dispatch and model APIs run on the internal network. The same event worker performs outbox relay and event consumption in this demo.

| Owner | Responsibility | Code |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gateway | Serve browser pages, verify demo bearer keys, forward only allowlisted routes, attach internal identity | [services/gateway.py](../services/gateway.py) |
| Trip API | Create and read rider trips, validate driver milestones, update trip state | [services/trips.py](../services/trips.py) |
| Dispatch API | Track availability and offers, reserve a driver atomically on acceptance | [services/dispatch.py](../services/dispatch.py) |
| Event worker | Publish acknowledged outbox events, deduplicate consumption, create offers, apply assignment and collect learning features | [workers/events.py](../workers/events.py) |
| Model API | Load versioned artifacts and score candidates with demand, acceptance, anomaly and policy signals | [ml/serve.py](../ml/serve.py) |
| RL watcher | Train candidates from completed rides. Review and approval run as separate commands. | [ml/rl.py](../ml/rl.py) |

### Web front end

The gateway serves two static pages and one shared script. Both pages call the gateway only; the browser never reaches the internal services.

| Page | Route | Uses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Passenger | `/` and `/passenger` → [`apps/passenger/index.html`](../apps/passenger/index.html) | `POST /v1/rider/trips` with an `Idempotency-Key`, then polls `GET /v1/rider/trips/{id}` |
| Driver | `/driver` → [`apps/driver/index.html`](../apps/driver/index.html) | `PUT /v1/driver/availability`, `GET /v1/driver/offers`, `POST /v1/driver/offers/{id}/accept`, `POST /v1/driver/trips/{id}/milestones` |
| Shared | `/assets/client.js` → [`apps/shared/client.js`](../apps/shared/client.js) | `request()` adds the role's demo bearer key; `refresh()` polls and renders; form handlers for booking and telemetry |

The Android app plays the same role as the passenger page. When connected, it must use the same `/v1/rider/...` routes through the gateway (see below).

## Class diagrams

The diagrams show classes declared by the starter. Inherited library methods are supplied by their base classes. Full type annotations, defaults, decorators and source lines are in the [generated symbol catalog](#generated-symbol-catalog).

### Booking and dispatch types

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseModel
    class Booking {
        +str pickup
        +str destination
        +Literal zone
    }
    class Milestone {
        +Literal status
    }
    class Telemetry {
        +bool online
        +float distance_km
        +float speed_kph
    }
    BaseModel <|-- Booking
    BaseModel <|-- Milestone
    BaseModel <|-- Telemetry
```

### Scoring types and LSTM

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class BaseModel
    class Candidate {
        +str driver_id
        +float distance_km
        +float speed_kph
    }
    class ScoringRequest {
        +Literal zone
        +list~Candidate~ drivers
    }
    class TorchModule
    class DemandLSTM {
        +LSTM recurrent
        +Linear output
        +__init__()
        +forward(values)
    }
    BaseModel <|-- Candidate
    BaseModel <|-- ScoringRequest
    ScoringRequest "1" *-- "1..20" Candidate : contains
    TorchModule <|-- DemandLSTM
```

### Database adapter

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class DB {
        +connection
        +__init__(connection)
        +run(query, *args)
    }
    class DBAPIConnection
    DB --> DBAPIConnection : wraps
```

`TorchModule` and `DBAPIConnection` represent external dependencies. The connection is either `sqlite3.Connection` or a Psycopg connection. The starter's service modules use functions and route decorators. Their signatures appear in the catalog.

## Persistence model

Cardinalities and key markers reflect the actual database constraints in [infra/schema.sql](../infra/schema.sql). `trips.driver_id` is a nullable text field. The assignment handler supplies its value.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    TRIPS ||--o| OFFERS : has
    DRIVERS ||--o{ OFFERS : receives
    TRIPS o|--o{ DRIVERS : "referenced by active_trip"
    TRIPS ||--o{ OUTBOX : emits
    TRIPS ||--o| EXPERIENCE : produces
    TRIPS {

        text body
        integer sent
    }
    INBOX {

    }
    EXPERIENCE {
        text trip_id PK, FK
        integer state

```

The compound unique key `trips(rider_id, request_key)` makes booking retries idempotent. The inbox primary key prevents duplicate event side effects. One offer and one learning record are stored per trip. The `pending_outbox(sent, seq)` index supports the relay.

### Databases at a glance

| Store | Owner | Engine | Holds | Durability |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `state.json` | Android app | JSON file, atomic replace | Basket, active ride and order, history, shared-seat counts, screen state | On the device only; deleted by Reset or uninstall |
| `atlas` database | Trip, Dispatch, event worker, RL watcher | PostgreSQL in Compose; SQLite in the local quickstart | `trips`, `drivers`, `offers`, `outbox`, `inbox`, `experience` ([schema](../infra/schema.sql)) | Transactional; outbox and inbox give at-least-once delivery without duplicate effects |
| `atlas.ride.v1` | Event worker | Kafka | Ride events keyed by trip ID ([schema](../packages/ride-event.schema.json)) | Broker log; consumer offsets committed after database effects |
| Artifact volume | Model API, worker, RL watcher | Files | Versioned models, manifest, demand features, candidate and active policies | Atomic active-policy pointer |

The device file and the server database share no schema today. The server is the future source of truth; the device would keep only a cache and screen state.

## Trip state machine

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> requested : Idempotent booking
    requested --> assigned : Assignment confirmation consumed
    assigned --> picked_up : Assigned driver submits pickup
    picked_up --> completed : Assigned driver submits completion
    completed --> [*]
```

| Transition or action | Durable effect |
| --- | --- |
| Create booking | Insert trip and `trip.requested` outbox row in one transaction. Same key and body returns the existing trip. Different body with the same key yields `409`. |
| Create offer | Score online, unreserved drivers. Insert one offer and `dispatch.offer.created`. |
| Accept offer | Check driver ownership and availability. Update the offer, reserve the driver, and insert `dispatch.assignment.confirmed` in one transaction. |
| Apply assignment | Conditionally move `requested` to `assigned` and emit `trip.assigned`. |
| Pick up | Check driver and prior state. Move `assigned` to `picked_up` and emit `trip.picked_up`. |
| Complete | Move `picked_up` to `completed`, release the driver's reservation, and emit `trip.completed`. |
| Process completion | Join the offer's original state, action and policy version to the terminal reward. Insert one experience row. |

## Sequence diagrams

### Passenger booking

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Passenger
    participant Gateway
    participant Trip
    participant Store
    Passenger->>Gateway: POST booking and idempotency key
    Gateway->>Trip: Forward authorized rider request
    Trip->>Store: Commit trip and trip.requested outbox row
    Store-->>Trip: Created or existing trip
    Trip-->>Gateway: 202 and trip snapshot
    Gateway-->>Passenger: 202 and trip ID
    Passenger->>Gateway: Poll trip status
```

### Event delivery and offer creation

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Store
    participant Worker
    participant Kafka
    participant Models
    Worker->>Store: Read first unsent outbox row
    Worker->>Kafka: Publish event with trip ID key
    Kafka-->>Worker: Broker acknowledgement
    Worker->>Store: Mark event sent
    Kafka->>Worker: Deliver trip.requested
    Worker->>Store: Deduplicate event and read eligible drivers
    Worker->>Models: POST candidate list and zone
    Models-->>Worker: Forecast, scores, flags and versions
    Worker->>Store: Commit offer, inbox key and new outbox row
    Worker->>Kafka: Commit consumer offset
```

If a relay crashes after the broker acknowledgement and before marking the event sent, the next attempt can publish the same event again. The inbox deduplication is in the same transaction as the event's database effects. The SQLite profile drives these handlers directly from the outbox.

### Driver acceptance and completion

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Driver
    participant Gateway
    participant Dispatch
    participant Worker
    participant Trip
    Driver->>Gateway: Poll offers and accept an offer
    Gateway->>Dispatch: Forward authenticated driver actions
    Dispatch-->>Gateway: 202 after reservation and outbox commit
    Dispatch-->>Worker: Assignment event via outbox and Kafka
    Worker-->>Trip: Apply assignment to shared trip storage
    Driver->>Gateway: Submit pickup and completion
    Gateway->>Trip: Forward driver milestone requests
    Trip-->>Worker: Completion event via outbox and Kafka
```

The worker applies assignment in the shared database. The diagram's dashed message to Trip represents that logical ownership boundary. There is no worker-to-Trip HTTP request.

### Training, serving and approval

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S["Seeded training data"] --> T["Train LSTM, acceptance and anomaly models"]
    T --> M["Versioned model files and manifest"]
    M --> I["Model serving API"]
    E["Committed ride events"] --> F["Demand buckets and terminal experiences"]
    F --> I
    F --> Q["Batch Q-learning candidate"]
    Q --> G{"Explicit approval and holdout checks"}
    G -->|Pass| P["Atomic active-policy pointer"]
    P --> I
    G -->|Reject| B["Keep current policy"]
```

The LSTM reads 12 five-minute counts. Logistic regression and Isolation Forest read distance and speed. The RL state is forecast bucket `0` below 8 or `1` at least 8. Action `0` ranks by distance and action `1` ranks by acceptance probability. The policy watcher creates candidates after at least 80 completed outcomes. Training does not activate candidates. Inference uses an approved strategy only when `ATLAS_POLICY_ENABLED=1`. Rollback restores the nearest-driver baseline.

## Connecting the Android app to the back end

This section is a design for the next step. None of it is implemented yet: the Android app makes no network calls.

### Repository boundary

Introduce a repository interface in the app. Keep `LocalStore` as the offline demo implementation and add a `RemoteRepository` that calls the gateway over HTTPS. Run network calls off Kivy's main thread and apply results back on it.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class PassengerRepository {
        <<interface>>
        +book(pickup, destination, comfort, offer_id, party)
        +ride_status(trip_id)
        +cancel_ride(trip_id)
        +shared_offers(pickup, destination, party)
        +restaurants()
        +menu(restaurant_id)
        +checkout(basket, address)
        +order_status(order_id)
        +history()
    }
    class LocalStore {
        offline demo · state.json
    }
    class RemoteRepository {
        +str base_url
        +TokenStore tokens
        +HttpClient http
    }
    class TokenStore {
        Android Keystore-backed
    }
    class AtlasGoApp
    PassengerRepository <|.. LocalStore
    PassengerRepository <|.. RemoteRepository
    AtlasGoApp --> PassengerRepository
    RemoteRepository --> TokenStore
```

### Command-to-API map

| App action | `LocalStore` today | Back end today | Gap to close |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Book a solo ride | `book(pickup, destination, comfort)` | `POST /v1/rider/trips` with `Idempotency-Key`; body `pickup`, `destination`, `zone` | Map place indexes to place names and a zone (`cork-centre` or `cork-north`); add fare quote and comfort option on the server |
| Watch a ride | `advance_ride()` on button press | `GET /v1/rider/trips/{id}` polling | Map server status to app stages: `requested` → finding a driver, `assigned` → driver confirmed, `picked_up` → on your way, `completed` → completed. The server has no separate "at pickup" status |
| Driver gets the pickup location | Simulated driver name | Worker creates an offer; driver page polls `GET /v1/driver/offers` and accepts | Driver app shows pickup text only; add GPS coordinates and routing as a separate extension |
| Cancel a ride | `advance_ride(cancel=True)` | Not available | Add a cancel route and a `cancelled` trip status |
| Shared ride | `Offer.matches`, `reserve`, `release` | Not available | [Proposed shared-ride API](#proposed-back-end-extensions-for-the-android-app) |
| Food menu, basket, checkout, tracking | `Cart`, `checkout`, `advance_order` | Not available | [Proposed food API](#proposed-back-end-extensions-for-the-android-app) |
| Activity | `history` in `state.json` | Not available | Add `GET /v1/rider/history` |
| Identity | None (guest profile) | Demo bearer keys per role | Real sign-in and token issuance before any public release |

### Connected booking sequence

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Passenger
    participant App as AtlasGoApp
    participant Repo as RemoteRepository
    participant Gateway
    participant Trip
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    Passenger->>App: Book ride
    App->>Repo: book(...) on a background thread
    Repo->>Gateway: POST /v1/rider/trips · Bearer token · Idempotency-Key
    Gateway->>Trip: Forward with internal rider identity
    Trip->>DB: Insert trip and trip.requested outbox row
    Trip-->>Gateway: 202 trip snapshot
    Gateway-->>Repo: 202 trip ID
    Repo-->>App: Show "requested" on the main thread
    loop Until completed
        Repo->>Gateway: GET /v1/rider/trips/{id}
        Gateway-->>Repo: status and driver_id
        Repo-->>App: Update stage
    end
```

Retries must reuse the same idempotency key, so a lost response never books twice. The phone never connects to Kafka, the database or the model API directly.

### Proposed back-end extensions for the Android app

These tables and routes are a proposal to support the app's food and shared-ride features. They are not in [`infra/schema.sql`](../infra/schema.sql) and no service implements them.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    RESTAURANTS ||--o{ MENU_ITEMS : offers
    RESTAURANTS ||--o{ FOOD_ORDERS : receives
    FOOD_ORDERS ||--|{ ORDER_ITEMS : contains
    MENU_ITEMS ||--o{ ORDER_ITEMS : "ordered as"

        text request_key
        text restaurant_id FK
        text address
        text status "placed, preparing, collected, delivered, cancelled"
        text courier_id
        integer total_cents
        bigint created_at
    }
    ORDER_ITEMS {
        text order_id PK, FK
        text item_id PK, FK
        integer quantity "1 to 10"
        integer unit_price_cents
    }
    SHARED_OFFERS {
        text id PK
        text driver_id FK
        text pickup
        text destination
        integer capacity
        integer seats_left
        integer price_cents
        bigint departs_at
    }
    SEAT_RESERVATIONS {
        text offer_id PK, FK
        text trip_id PK, FK
        integer party "1 or 2"
    }
```

Rules carried over from the app: `UNIQUE (rider_id, request_key)` on `food_orders`; one restaurant per order; at most ten of each item; prices copied into `order_items` at checkout; seat reservation as one conditional update (`seats_left = seats_left - party WHERE seats_left >= party`) in the same transaction as its outbox row; cancellation returns seats. Totals and seat counts are decided by the server, never by the phone.

| Proposed route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v1/rider/restaurants` · `GET /v1/rider/restaurants/{id}/menu` | Restaurant list and menu with server prices |
| `POST /v1/rider/orders` (`Idempotency-Key`) · `GET /v1/rider/orders/{id}` | Checkout and order tracking (`food.order.placed` … `food.order.delivered` events) |
| `POST /v1/courier/orders/{id}/milestones` | Courier collects at the restaurant and delivers to the address |
| `GET /v1/rider/shared-offers?pickup=&destination=&party=` · `POST /v1/rider/shared-offers/{id}/reserve` | Shared-ride search and atomic seat reservation |
| `POST /v1/rider/trips/{id}/cancel` | Ride cancellation; releases driver and seats |
| `GET /v1/rider/history` | Activity screen |

Each new route must be added to the gateway's `ROUTES` allowlist with its role.

## Rebuild checklist

1. Run the [starter smoke and policy checks](../README.md#start-with-postgresql-and-kafka) against the existing code. Use the request paths and payloads in the [API contract](../README.md#api-and-data-contracts) as the compatibility baseline.
2. Implement changes through existing boundaries. Preserve rider and driver ownership, transactional state and outbox writes, deduplication, the state machine, model versions and explicit policy approval.
3. Test one complete ride, a booking retry with the same key, a forbidden offer acceptance, an invalid state transition, model outputs and one terminal experience. Run `tests.replay` against the configured Kafka broker before claiming deployment readiness.
4. Treat GPS, routing, offer expiry and re-matching, cancellations, payments, production identity and representative training data as separately scoped extensions.
5. For the Android app, run `python -m pytest tests` in `android-app/` on the `main` branch and the emulator acceptance workflow before and after changes. When connecting it to the back end, add the repository interface first, keep `LocalStore` passing its tests, and test `RemoteRepository` against a staging gateway.
6. Regenerate the blueprint after changing code. Commit the updated generated sections and JSON with the source changes.

From `starter/`, use Python 3.12 and Node.js with npm. The generator uses the Python standard library and the pinned Acorn parser for JavaScript.

```bash
python scripts/generate_blueprint.py
python scripts/generate_blueprint.py --check
```

The JSON includes relative paths, source hashes, imports, class bases, attributes, method signatures, module functions, nested functions, callbacks, decorators and source lines. The application catalog covers the starter and its tests. The supporting catalog covers the explorer, Node static server and blueprint generator. The [handover runbook](FINAL_HANDOVER.md) specifies exact API responses, environment variables, model artifacts and acceptance steps.
